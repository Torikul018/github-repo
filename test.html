        <header><b><strong>O</strong></b>nce upon a time there was a clever fox. One day he was walking inside the forest. Suddenly he fall into a grave and when we wake up he saw that he losts his tail. He was looking so strange so he made a plan. He called all the fox in the forest and told them look we are not looking smart enough because of our tail. Look at me how beautifull I'm looking at that time all the fox preset there was taling with each other, Yeah he is right we should cutt off our tails but what the other animale say. Then there a older fox comes and said don't listen to him he lose his tail by falling into a grave now he want to make us look like him. When the Tail less fox listen that he hide and run from there.</header>
